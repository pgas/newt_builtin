bash loadable builtin around newt

Newt
----

Newt is a programming library for color text mode, widget based user
interfaces.  Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets,
checkboxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars,
etc., to text mode user interfaces.  Newt is based on the slang
library.

Installation
-------------

* create  a python virutal env:

`virtualenv ENV && source ENV/bin/activate`

* install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* configure inside the virtual env

`. ENV/bin/activate`
`./configure`

* compile the builtin

`make`

* enable the builtin

`enable -ff ./.libs/newt.sh  newt`
`newt init`

Tests
-------------
To be able to run the tests, you will need a fully compiled bash source tree.
by default it looks for this in ../bash, you can also use the option --with-bash-sources.


"libbash"
-------------
To be able to use the functions defined in bash, the configure script
creates a "libbash". The current solution is not very elegant but
as it is used only for development this will do for now

What is does is first to rename "main" so that we don't have a
conflict and then link all the .o in the top source dir

`   objcopy --redefine-sym main=shell_main $with_bash_sources/shell.o`
`   ar rvs libbash.a $with_bash_sources/*.o`
The other objects are linked using the same .a bash is using

**Bugs**:

1) it is perhaps not that robust against different version of bash
2) feels hackish renaming "name"  in the object

Thoughts
------

* It's not a good idea to all newt in different subshells...maybe it
  could be a good idea to verify that calls that assign/destroy
  components are called in the same pid as newtInit

* what to do with return values?

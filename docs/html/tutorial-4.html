<h2><a name="s4">4. Components</a></h2>

<p>Components are the basic user interface element <code>newt</code> provides. A
single component may be (for example) a listbox, push button checkbox,
a collection of other components. Most components are used to display
information in a window, provide a place for the user to enter data, or a
combination of these two functions. 
<p>Forms, however, are a component whose primary purpose is not noticed by
the user at all. Forms are collections of components (a form may contain
another form) which logically relate the components to one another. Once
a form is created and had all of its consituent components added to it,
applications normally then run the form.  This gives control of the
application to the form, which then lets the user enter data onto the
form. When the user is done (a number of different events qualify as
``done''), the form returns control to the part of the application which
invoked it. The application may then read the information the user provided
and continue appropriately.
<p>All <code>newt</code> components are stored in a common data type, a
<code>newtComponent</code> (some of the particulars of <code>newtComponents</code>s have
already been mentioned. While this makes it easy for programmers to pass
components around, it does force them to make sure they use they don't pass
entry boxes to routines expecting push buttons, as the compiler can't
ensure that for them.
<p>We start off with a brief introduction to forms. While not terribly
complete, this introduction is enough to let us illustrate the rest of
the components with some sample code. We'll then discuss the remainder of
the components, and end this section with a more exhaustive description of
forms.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.1">4.1 Introduction to Forms</a>
</h2>

<p>As we've mentioned, forms are simply collections of components. As only one
form can be active (or running) at a time, every component which the user
should be able to access must be on the running form (or on a subform of
the running form). A form is itself a component, which means forms are
stored in <code>newtComponent</code> data structures.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtForm(newtComponent vertBar, const char * help, int flags);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>To create a form, call <code>newtForm()</code>. The first parameter is a vertical
scrollbar which should be associated with the form. For now, that should
always be <code>NULL</code> (we'll discuss how to create scrolling forms later in
this section). The second parameter, <code>help</code>, is currently unused and
should always be <code>NULL</code>. The <code>flags</code> is normally 0, and othervalues
it can take will be discussed later. Now that we've waved away the
complexity of this function, creating a form boils down to simply:
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent myForm;

myForm = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>After a form is created, components need to be added to it --- after all,
an empty form isn't terribly usefull. There are two functions which add
components to a form.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
void newtFormAddComponent(newtComponent form, newtComponent co);
void newtFormAddComponents(newtComponent form, ...);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>The first function, <code>newtFormAddComponent()</code>, adds a single component
to the form which is passed as the first parameter. The second function
is simply a convience function. After passing the form to
<code>newtFormAddComponents()</code>, an arbitrary number of components is then
passed, followed by <code>NULL</code>. Every component passed is added to the form.
<p>Once a form has been created and components have been added to it, it's
time to run the form.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtRunForm(newtComponent form);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>This function runs the form passed to it, and returns the component which
caused the form to stop running. For now, we'll ignore the return value
completely.
<p>Notice that this function doesn't fit in with <code>newt</code>'s normal
naming convention. It is an older interface which will not work for all
forms. It was left in <code>newt</code> only for legacy applications. It is a
simpler interface then the new <code>newtFormRun()</code> though, and is still used
quite often as a result.
<p>When an application is done with a form, it destroys the form and
all of the components the form contains.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
void newtFormDestroy(newtComponent form);       
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>This function frees the memory resources used by the form and all of the
components which have been added to the form (including those components
which are on subforms). Once a form has been destroyed, none of the form's
components can be used.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.2">4.2 Components</a>
</h2>

<p>Non-form components are the most important user-interface component for
users. They determine how users interact with <code>newt</code> and how information
is presented to them.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.3">4.3 General Component Manipulation</a>
</h2>

<p>There are a couple of functions which work on more then one type of
components. The description of each component indicates which (if any)
of these functions are valid for that particular component.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
typedef void (*newtCallback)(newtComponent, void *);

void newtComponentAddCallback(newtComponent co, newtCallback f, void * data);
void newtComponentTakesFocus(newtComponent co, int val);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>The first registers a callback function for that component. A callback
function is a function the application provides which <code>newt</code> calls for a
particular component. Exactly when (if ever) the callback is invoked
depends on the type of component the callback is attached to, and will be
discussed for the components which support callbacks.
<p><code>newtComponentTakesFocus()</code> works on all components. It allows the
application to change which components the user is allowed to select as the
current component, and hence provide input to. Components which do not
take focus are skipped over during form traversal, but they are displayed
on the terminal. Some components should never be set to take focus, such
as those which display static text.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.4">4.4 Buttons</a>
</h2>

<p>Nearly all forms contain at least one button. <code>Newt</code> buttons come in two
flavors, full buttons and compact buttons. Full buttons take up quit a bit
of screen space, but look much better then the single-row compact buttons.
Other then their size, both button styles behave identically. Different
functions are used to create the two types of buttons.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtButton(int left, int top, const char * text);
newtComponent newtCompactButton(int left, int top, const char * text);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>Both functions take identical paramters. The first two parameters are the
location of the upper left corner of the button, and the final parameter is
the text which should be displayed in the button (such as ``Ok'' or
``Cancel'').
<p>
<h3>Button Example</h3>

<p>Here is a simple example of both full and compact buttons. It also
illustrates opening and closing windows, as well a simple form.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#include &lt;newt.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, b1, b2;
    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 40, 6, "Button Sample");

    b1 = newtButton(10, 1, "Ok");
    b2 = newtCompactButton(22, 2, "Cancel");
    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponents(form, b1, b2, NULL);

    newtRunForm(form);

    newtFormDestroy(form);
    newtFinished();
}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.5">4.5 Labels</a>
</h2>

<p>Labels are <code>newt</code>'s simplest component. They display some given text and
don't allow any user input.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtLabel(int left, int top, const char * text);
void newtLabelSetText(newtComponent co, const char * text);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>Creating a label is just like creating a button; just pass the location of
the label and the text it should display. Unlike buttons, labels do let the
application change the text in the label with <code>newtLabelSetText</code>. When
the label's text is changed, the label automatically redraws itself. It
does not clear out any old text which may be leftover from the previous
time is was displayed, however, so be sure that the new text is at least
as long as the old text.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.6">4.6 Entry Boxes</a>
</h2>

<p>Entry boxes allow the user to enter a text string into the form which the
application can later retrieve.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
typedef int (*newtEntryFilter)(newtComponent entry, void * data, int ch,
                               int cursor);

newtComponent newtEntry(int left, int top, const char * initialValue, int width,
                        char ** resultPtr, int flags);
void newtEntrySet(newtComponent co, const char * value, int cursorAtEnd);
char * newtEntryGetValue(newtComponent co);
void newtEntrySetFilter(newtComponent co, newtEntryFilter filter, void * data);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<p><code>newtEntry()</code> creates a new entry box. After the location of the entry
box, the initial value for the entry box is passed, which may be <code>NULL</code>
if the box should start off empty. Next, the width of the phsyical box is
given. This width may or may not limit the length of the string the user is
allowed to enter; that depends on the <code>flags</code>. The <code>resultPtr</code> must
be the address of a <code>char *</code>. Until the entry box is destroyed by
<code>newtFormDestroy()</code>, that <code>char *</code> will point to the current value
of the entry box. It's important that applications make a copy of that
value before destroying the form if they need to use it later. The
<code>resultPtr</code> may be <code>NULL</code>, in which case the user must use the
<code>newtEntryGetValue()</code> function to get the value of the entry box.
<p>Entry boxes support a number of flags:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>NEWT_ENTRY_SCROLL</b><dd><p>If this flag is not specified, the user cannot
enter text into the entry box which is wider then the entry box itself.
This flag removes this limitation, and lets the user enter data of an
arbitrary length.
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_HIDDEN</b><dd><p>If this flag is specified, the value of the entry box
is not displayed. This is usefull when the application needs to read a
password, for example.
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</b><dd><p>When this flag is given, the entry box will cause
the form to stop running if the user pressed return inside of the entry
box. This can provide a nice shortcut for users.
</dl>
<p>
<p>After an entry box has been created, it's contents can be set by
<code>newtEntrySet()</code>. After the entry box itself, the new string to place
in the entry box is passed. The final parameter, <code>cursorAtEnd</code>, controls
where the cursor will appear in the entry box. If it is zero, the cursor
remains at it's present location; a nonzero value moves the cursor to the
end of the entry box's new value.
<p>While the simplest way to find the value of an entry box is by using a
<code>resultPtr</code>, doing so complicates some applications.
<code>newtEntryGetValue()</code> returns a pointer to the string which the entry
box currently contains. The returned pointer may not be valid once the
user further modifies the entry box, and will not be valid after the 
entry box has been destroyed, so be sure to save it's value in a more
permanent location if necessary.
<p>Entry boxes allow applications to filter characters as they are entered.
This allows programs to ignore characters which are invalid (such as
entering a ^ in the middle of a phone number) and provide intelligent aids
to the user (such as automatically adding a '.' after the user has typed in
the first three numbers in an IP address). 
<p>When a filter is registered through <code>newtEntrySetFilter()</code>, both the
filter itself and an aribtrary <code>void *</code>, which passed to the filter
whenever it is invoked, are recorded. This data pointer isn't used for any
other purpose, and may be <code>NULL</code>. Entry filters take four arguments.
<p>
<ol>
<li>The entry box which had data entered into it</li>
<li>The data pointer which was registered along with the filter</li>
<li>The new character which <code>newt</code> is considering inserting into the
entry box</li>
<li>The current cursor position (0 is the leftmost position)</li>
</ol>
<p>The filter returns 0 if the character should be ignored, or the value of
the character which should be inserted into the entry box. Filter functions
which want to do complex manipulations of the string should use
<code>newtEntrySet()</code> to update the entry box and then return 0 to prevent
the new character from being inserted.
<p>When a callback is attached to a entry box, the callback is invoked
whenever the user moves off of the callback and on to another component.
<p>Here is a sample program which illustrates the use of both labels and
entry boxes.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#include &lt;newt.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, label, entry, button;
    char * entryValue;

    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 40, 8, "Entry and Label Sample");

    label = newtLabel(1, 1, "Enter a string");
    entry = newtEntry(16, 1, "sample", 20, &amp;entryValue, 
                      NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL | NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT);
    button = newtButton(17, 3, "Ok");
    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponents(form, label, entry, button, NULL);

    newtRunForm(form);

    newtFinished();

    printf("Final string was: %s\n", entryValue);

    /* We cannot destroy the form until after we've used the value
       from the entry widget. */
    newtFormDestroy(form);
}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.7">4.7 Checkboxes</a>
</h2>

<p>Most widget sets include checkboxes which toggle between two value (checked
or not checked). <code>Newt</code> checkboxes are more flexible. When the user
presses the space bar on a checkbox, the checkbox's value changes to the
next value in an arbitrary sequence (which wraps). Most checkboxes have
two items in that sequence, checked or not, but <code>newt</code> allows an
arbitrary number of value. This is usefull when the user must pick from a
limited number of choices.
<p>Each item in the sequence is a single character, and the sequence itself is
represented as a string. The checkbox comoonents displays the character
which currently represents its value the left of a text label, and returns
the same character as its current value. The default sequence for
checkboxes is <code>" *"</code>, with <code>' '</code> indicating false and <code>'*'</code> true.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtCheckbox(int left, int top, const char * text, char defValue,
                           const char * seq, char * result);
char newtCheckboxGetValue(newtComponent co);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Like most components, the position of the checkbox is the first thing
passed to the function that creates one. The next parameter, <code>text</code>, is
the text which is displayed to the right of the area which is checked.  The
<code>defValue</code> is the initial value for the checkbox, and <code>seq</code> is the
sequence which the checkbox should go through (<code>defValue</code> must be
in <code>seq</code>. <code>seq</code> may be <code>NULL</code>, in which case <code>" *"</code> is used.
The final parameter, <code>result</code>, should point to a character which the
checkbox should always record it's current value in. If <code>result</code> is
<code>NULL</code>, <code>newtCheckboxGetValue()</code> must be used to get the current
value of the checkbox.
<p><code>newtCheckboxGetValue()</code> is straightforward, returning the character
in the sequence which indicates the current value of the checkboxl
<p>If a callback is attached to a checkbox, the callback is invoked whenever
the checkbox responds to a user's keystroke. The entry box may respond by
taking focus or giving up focus, as well as by changing its current value.

<h2><a name="ss4.8">4.8 Radio Buttons</a>
</h2>

<p>Radio buttons look very similiar to checkboxes. The key difference between
the two is that radio buttons are grouped into sets, and exactly one radio
button in that set may be turned on. If another radio button is selected,
the button which was selected is automatically deselected.
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtRadiobutton(int left, int top, const char * text, 
                              int isDefault, newtComponent prevButton);
newtComponent newtRadioGetCurrent(newtComponent setMember);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>Each radio button is created by calling <code>newtRadiobutton()</code>. After
the position of the radio button, the text displayed with the button
is passed. <code>isDefault</code> should be nonzero if the radio button is to
be turned on by default. The final paramater, <code>prevMember</code> is used
to group radio buttons into sets. If <code>prevMember</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the 
radio button is assigned to a new set. If the radio button should belong
to a preexisting set, <code>prevMember</code> must be the previous radio button
added to that set.
<p>Discovering which radio button in a set is currently selected neccesitates
<code>newtRadioGetCurrent()</code>. It may be passed any radio button in the set
you're inerested in, and it returns the radio button component currently
selected.
<p>Here is an example of both checkboxes and radio buttons.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#include &lt;newt.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, checkbox, rb[3], button;
    char cbValue;
    int i;

    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 40, 11, "Checkboxes and Radio buttons");

    checkbox = newtCheckbox(1, 1, "A checkbox", ' ', " *X", &amp;cbValue);

    rb[0] = newtRadiobutton(1, 3, "Choice 1", 1, NULL);
    rb[1] = newtRadiobutton(1, 4, "Choice 2", 0, rb[0]);
    rb[2] = newtRadiobutton(1, 5, "Choice 3", 0, rb[1]);

    button = newtButton(1, 7, "Ok");

    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponent(form, checkbox);
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
        newtFormAddComponent(form, rb[i]);
    newtFormAddComponent(form, button);

    newtRunForm(form);
    newtFinished();

    /* We cannot destroy the form until after we've found the current
       radio button */

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
        if (newtRadioGetCurrent(rb[0]) == rb[i])
            printf("radio button picked: %d\n", i);
    newtFormDestroy(form);

    /* But the checkbox's value is stored locally */
    printf("checkbox value: '%c'\n", cbValue);
}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.9">4.9 Scales</a>
</h2>

<p>It's common for programs to need to display a progress meter on the
terminal while it performs somey length operation (it behaves like an
anaesthetic). The scale component is a simple way of doing this. It
displays a horizontal bar graph which the application can update as the
operation continues.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtScale(int left, int top, int width, long long fullValue);
void newtScaleSet(newtComponent co, unsigned long long amount);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>When the scale is created with <code>newtScale</code>, it is given the width of the
scale itself as well as the value which means that the scale should be
drawn as full. When the position of the scale is set with
<code>newtScaleSet()</code>, the scale is told the amount of the scale which should
be filled in realative to the <code>fullAmount</code>. For example, if the
application is copying a file, <code>fullValue</code> could be the number of bytes
in the file, and when the scale is updated <code>newtScaleSet()</code> would be
passed the number of bytes which have been copied so far.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.10">4.10 Textboxes</a>
</h2>

<p>Textboxes display a block of text on the terminal, and is appropriate for
display large amounts of text. 
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtTextbox(int left, int top, int width, int height, int flags);
void newtTextboxSetText(newtComponent co, const char * text);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p><code>newtTextbox()</code> creates a new textbox, but does not fill it with data.
The function is passed the location for the textbox on the screen, the
width and height of the textbox (in characters), and zero or more of the
following flags:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_WRAP</b><dd><p>All text in the textbox should be wrapped to fit
the width of the textbox. If this flag is not specified, each newline
delimited line in the text is trunctated if it is too long to fit.
<p>When <code>newt</code> wraps text, it tries not to break lines on spaces or tabs.
Literal newline characters are respected, and may be used to force line
breaks.
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL</b><dd><p>The text box should be scrollable. When this option
is used, the scrollbar which is added increases the width of the area used
by the textbox by 2 characters; that is the textbox is 2 characters wider
then the width passed to <code>newtTextbox()</code>.
</dl>
<p>
<p>
<p>After a textbox has been created, text may be added to it through
<code>newtTextboxSetText()</code>, which takes only the textbox and the new text as
parameters. If the textbox already contained text, that text is replaced by
the new text. The textbox makes its own copy of the passed text, so these
is no need to keep the original around unless it's convienent.
<p>
<h3>Reflowing Text</h3>

<p>When applications need to display large amounts of text, it's common not to
know exactly where the linebreaks should go. While textboxes are quite
willing to scroll the text, the programmer still must know what width the
text will look ``best'' at (where ``best'' means most exactly rectangular;
no lines much shorter or much longer then the rest). This common is
escpecially prevalent in internationalized programs, which need to make a
wide variety of message string look god on a screen.
<p>To help with this, <code>newt</code> provides routines to reformat text to look
good. It tries different widths to figure out which one will look ``best''
to the user. As these commons are almost always used to format text for
textbox components, <code>newt</code> makes it easy to construct a textbox with
reflowed text.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
char * newtReflowText(char * text, int width, int flexDown, int flexUp,
                      int * actualWidth, int * actualHeight);
newtComponent newtTextboxReflowed(int left, int top, char * text, int width,
                                  int flexDown, int flexUp, int flags);
int newtTextboxGetNumLines(newtComponent co);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<p><code>newtReflowText()</code> reflows the <code>text</code> to a target width of
<code>width</code>. The actual width of the longest line in the returned string is
between <code>width - flexDown</code> and <code>width + flexUp</code>; the actual maximum
line length is chosen to make the displayed check look rectuangular. 
The <code>int</code>s pointed to by <code>actualWidth</code> and <code>actualHeight</code> are set
to the width of the longest line and the number of lines in in the
returned text, respectively. Either one may be <code>NULL</code>. The return
value points to the reflowed text, and is allocated through <code>malloc()</code>.
<p>When the reflowed text is being placed in a textbox it may be easier to use
<code>newtTextboxReflowed()</code>, which creates a textbox, reflows the text, and
places the reflowed text in the listbox. It's parameters consist of the
position of the final textbox, the width and flex values for the text
(which are identical to the parameters passed to <code>newtReflowText()</code>,
and the flags for the textbox (which are the same as the flags for
<code>newtTextbox()</code>. This function does not let you limit the height of the
textbox, however, making limiting it's use to contructing textbox's which
don't need to scroll.
<p>To find out how tall the textbox created by <code>newtTextboxReflowed()</code> is, 
use <code>newtTextboxGetNumLines()</code>, which returns the number of lines in the
textbox. For textboxes created by <code>newtTextboxReflowed()</code>, this is
always the same as the height of the textbox.
<p>Here's a simple program which uses a textbox to display a message.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#include &lt;newt.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

char message[] = "This is a pretty long message. It will be displayed "
                 "in a newt textbox, and illustrates how to construct "
                 "a textbox from arbitrary text which may not have "
                 "very good line breaks.\n\n"
                 "Notice how literal \\n characters are respected, and "
                 "may be used to force line breaks and blank lines.";

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, text, button;

    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    text = newtTextboxReflowed(1, 1, message, 30, 5, 5, 0);
    button = newtButton(12, newtTextboxGetNumLines(text) + 2, "Ok");

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 37,
                   newtTextboxGetNumLines(text) + 7, "Textboxes");

    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponents(form, text, button, NULL);

    newtRunForm(form);
    newtFormDestroy(form);
    newtFinished();
}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.11">4.11 Scrollbars</a>
</h2>

<p>Scrollbars (which, currently, are always vertical in <code>newt</code>), may be
attached to forms to let them contain more data then they have space for.
While the actual process of making scrolling forms is discussed at the end 
of this section, we'll go ahead and introduct scrollbars now so you'll be
ready.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtVerticalScrollbar(int left, int top, int height,
                                    int normalColorset, int thumbColorset);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>When a scrollbar is created, it is given a position on the screen, a
height, and two colors. The first color is the color used for drawing the
scrollbar, and the second color is used for drawing the thumb. This is the
only place in newt where an application specifically sets colors for a
component. It's done here to let the colors a scrollbar use match the
colors of the component the scrollbar is mated too. When a scrollbar is
being used with a form, <code>normalColorset</code> is often
<code>NEWT_COLORSET_WINDOW</code> and <code>thumbColorset</code>
<code>NEWT_COLORSET_ACTCHECKBOX</code>. Of course, feel free to puruse
<code>&lt;newt.h&gt;</code> and pick your own colors.
<p>As the scrollbar is normally updated by the component it is mated with,
there is no public interface for moving the thumb.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.12">4.12 Listboxes</a>
Listboxes are the most complicated components <code>newt</code> provides. They canallow a single selection or multiple selection, and are easy to update.Unfortunately, their API is also the least consistent of <code>newt</code>'scomponents. Each entry in a listbox is a ordered pair of the text which should bedisplayed for that item and a <b>key</b>, which is a <code>void *</code> thatuniquely identifies that listbox item. Many applications pass integers inas keys, but using arbitrary pointers makes many applications significantlyeasier to code.</h2>

<h3>Basic Listboxes</h3>

<p>Let's start off by looking at the most important listbox functions.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtListbox(int left, int top, int height, int flags);
int newtListboxAppendEntry(newtComponent co, const char * text, 
                           const void * data);
void * newtListboxGetCurrent(newtComponent co);
void newtListboxSetWidth(newtComponent co, int width);
void newtListboxSetCurrent(newtComponent co, int num);
void newtListboxSetCurrentByKey(newtComponent co, void * key);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<p>A listbox is created at a certain position and a given height. The
<code>height</code> is used for two things. First of all, it is the minimum
height the listbox will use. If there are less items in the listbox then
the height, suggests the listbox will still take up that minimum amount
of space. Secondly, if the listbox is set to be scrollable (by setting
the <code>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL flag</code>, the <code>height</code> is also the maximum height
of the listbox. If the listbox may not scroll, it increases its height to
display all of its items.
<p>The following flags may be used when creating a listbox:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL</b><dd><p>The listbox should scroll to display all of the
items it contains.
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</b><dd><p>When the user presses return on an item in the
list, the form should return.
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_BORDER</b><dd><p>A frame is drawn around the listbox, which can make
it easier to see which listbox has the focus when a form contains multiple
listboxes.
<dt><b>NEWT_FLAG_MULTIPLE</b><dd><p>By default, a listbox only lets the user select
one item in the list at a time. When this flag is specified, they may
select multiple items from the list.
</dl>
<p>
<p>Once a listbox has been created, items are added to it by invoking
<code>newtListboxAppendEntry()</code>, which adds new items to the end of the list.
In addition to the listbox component, <code>newtListboxAppendEntry()</code> needs
both elements of the (text, key) ordered pair. 
<p>For lists which only allow a single selection, <code>newtListboxGetCurrent()</code>
should be used to find out which listbox item is currently selected. It
returns the key of the currently selected item.
<p>Normally, a listbox is as wide as it's widest element, plus space for a
scrollbar if the listbox is supposed to have one. To make the listbox
any larger then that, use <code>newtListboxSetWidth()</code>, which overrides the
natural lis of the listbox. Once the width has been set, it's fixed. The
listbox will no longer grow to accomodate new entries, so bad things may
happen! 
<p>An application can change the current position of the listbox (where the
selection bar is displayed) by calling <code>newtListboxSetCurrent()</code> or
<code>newtListboxSetCurrentByKey()</code>. The first sets the current position to the
entry number which is passed as the second argument, with 0 indicating
the first entry. <code>newtListboxSetCurrentByKey()</code> sets the current position
to the entry whose <code>key</code> is passed into the function.
<p>
<h3>Manipulating Listbox Contents</h3>

<p>While the contents of many listboxes never need to change, some applications
need to change the contents of listboxes regularly. <code>Newt</code> includes
complete support for updating listboxes. These new functions are in
addtion to <code>newtListboxAppendEntry()</code>, which was already discussed.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
void newtListboxSetEntry(newtComponent co, void * key, const char * text);
int newtListboxInsertEntry(newtComponent co, const char * text, 
                           const void * data, void * key);
int newtListboxDeleteEntry(newtComponent co, void * key);
void newtListboxClear(newtComponent co);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The first of these, <code>newtListboxSetEntry()</code>, updates the text for a
key which is already in the listbox. The <code>key</code> specifies which listbox
entry should be modified, and <code>text</code> becomes the new text for that entry
in the listbox.
<p><code>newtListboxInsertEntry()</code> inserts a new listbox entry <b>after</b> an
already existing entry, which is specified by the <code>key</code> parameter.
The <code>text</code> and <code>data</code> parameters specify the new entry which should
be added.
<p>Already-existing entries are removed from a listbox with
<code>newtListboxDeleteEntry()</code>. It removes the listbox entry with the
specified <code>key</code>. If you want to remove all of the entries from a
listbox, use <code>newtListboxClear()</code>. 
<p>
<h3>Multiple Selections</h3>

<p>When a listbox is created with <code>NEWT_FLAG_MULTIPLE</code>, the user can select
multiple items from the list. When this option is used, a different set of
functions must be used to manipulate the listbox selection.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
void newtListboxClearSelection(newtComponent co);
void **newtListboxGetSelection(newtComponent co, int *numitems);
void newtListboxSelectItem(newtComponent co, const void * key,
                           enum newtFlagsSense sense);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>The simplest of these is <code>newtListboxClearSelection()</code>, which deselects
all of the items in the list (listboxes which allow multiple selections
also allow zero selections). <code>newtListboxGetSelection()</code> returns a
pointer to an array which contains the keys for all of the items in the
listbox currently selected. The <code>int</code> pointed to by <code>numitems</code> is
set to the number of items currently selected (and hence the number of
items in the returned array). The returned array is dynamically allocated,
and must be released through <code>free()</code>.
<p><code>newtListboxSelectItem()</code> lets the program select and deselect specific
listbox entries. The <code>key</code> of the listbox entry is being affected is
passed, and <code>sense</code> is one of <code>NEWT_FLAGS_RESET</code>, which deselects
the entry, <code>NEWT_FLAGS_SET</code>, which selects the entry, or
<code>NEWT_FLAGS_TOGGLE</code>, which reverses the current selection status.
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="ss4.13">4.13 Advanced Forms</a>
</h2>

<p>Forms, which tie components together, are quite important in the world of
<code>newt</code>. While we've already discussed the basics of forms, we've omitted
many of the details.
<p>
<h3>Exiting From Forms</h3>

<p>Forms return control to the application for a number of reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A component can force the form to exit. Buttons do this whenever they
are pushed, and other components exit when <code>NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</code> has
been specified.</li>
<li>Applications can setup hot keys which cause the form to exit when
they are pressed.</li>
<li><code>Newt</code> can exit when file descriptors are ready to be read or
ready to be written to.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, <code>newt</code> forms exit when the F12 key is pressed (F12 is setup
as a hot key by default). <code>Newt</code> applications should treat F12 as an
``Ok'' button. If applications don't want F12 to exit the form, they can
specify <code>NEWT_FLAG_NOF12</code> as flag when creating the form with 
<code>newtForm</code>.
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
void newtFormAddHotKey(newtComponent co, int key);
void newtFormWatchFd(newtComponent form, int fd, int fdFlags);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
void newtDrawForm(newtComponent form);
newtComponent newtFormGetCurrent(newtComponent co);
void newtFormSetCurrent(newtComponent co, newtComponent subco);
void newtFormRun(newtComponent co, struct newtExitStruct * es);
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
newtComponent newtForm(newtComponent vertBar, const char * help, int flags);
void newtFormSetBackground(newtComponent co, int color);
void newtFormSetHeight(newtComponent co, int height);
void newtFormSetWidth(newtComponent co, int width);
</pre>
